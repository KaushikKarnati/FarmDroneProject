<h1> Farm Application:</h1>
Our group has created a dashboard for our automated drone farm application.This application also depicts the movement of the drone in a farm.

<br>


<h2>[GitLab Repository for the Project](https://gitlab.cs.uab.edu/skarnati/DroneSmartFarm.git) </h2>

<h3>Application Instructions</h3>

1. Run the Java project in IntelliJ IDEA by opening the project directory, and running it from the **MainApp** class.
2. You may add, edit, and delete items and item containers (excluding the farm, which is the root item container)
   by utilizing the on screen text inputs and buttons.
3. After you have created the farm items in their desired locations, you may begin the drone animation.
   The on screen buttons can be used to control the drone animation. To have the drone fly to an item, select the desired item in the tree view.
4. After selecting the item you'd like the drone to fly to, click the "Visit Item" button. The drone will then travel to the (X,Y) coordinates at the object's center.
5. You may also click "Scan Farm" to have the drone fly over the entirety of the farm.

<h3> Application Requirements </h3>

This project was created with Java JDK 8 (often listed as version string 1.8) and JavaFX.
Our team used IntelliJ IDEA to create this project.

We recommend you use IntelliJ when viewing this code or running the project.

Eclipse will most likely work, but may need some tweaking since migrating projects between Eclipse and IntelliJ is often unpredictable.
