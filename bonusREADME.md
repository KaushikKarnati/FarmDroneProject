<h1> Bonus Assignment </h1> <br>
<h6> The feature implemented here is the undo and redo using command pattern. </h6> <br>
<p> We added a add item button, add item container button, save item button, and a delete Item button. The functionalities of these buttons are:<br>
1. Add Item Container button: Adds an item container to the dashboard where the positioning and the name of the item container can be customized. <br>
2. Add Item button: Adds an item to the dashboard where the item positioning and the name can be customized. An item can only be created under an item container. <br>
3. Save Item: This button saves the item and the item container and its configuration. After every item container or an item container is created, we must hit save item to save that item or the item container. <br>
4. Delete Item: This button deletes the selected item or item container along with its configurations. <br><br>

NOTE: For every button, a handler is written which carries out the necessary operations required. Also, the code for error dialog is written in order to make the feature more interactive with the user.</p>
